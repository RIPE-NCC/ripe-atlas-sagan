.. _ping:

Ping
====

The simplest measurement type, ``ping`` measurement results contain all of the
properties :ref:`common to all measurements <common-attributes>` as well as the following:

=====================  =====  ===================================================================================
Property               Type   Explanation
=====================  =====  ===================================================================================
af                     int    The address family.  It's always either a ``4`` or a ``6``.

rtt_average            float
rtt_median             float
rtt_min                float
rtt_max                float
packets_sent           int
packets_received       int
packet_size            int
destination_name       str    The string initially given as the target.  It can be an IP address or a domain name

step                   int    The number of seconds between ping requests (interval)
packets                list   A list of ping :ref:`ping-packet` objects
=====================  =====  ===================================================================================


.. _ping-packet:

Packet
------

Each ping request sends ``n`` packets, where ``n`` is a value specified at
measurement creation time.  We represent these packets as ``Packet`` objects.

=====================  =====  ================================================================
Property               Type   Explanation
=====================  =====  ================================================================
rtt                    float

ttl                    int
source_address         str    An IP address represented as a string
=====================  =====  ================================================================


.. _traceroute:

Traceroute
==========

Probably the largest result type, ``traceroute`` measurement results contain all
of the properties :ref:`common to all measurements <common-attributes>` as well as the following:

========================  ========  ===================================================================================
Property                  Type      Explanation
========================  ========  ===================================================================================
af                        int       The address family.  It's always either a ``4`` or a ``6``.
destination_name          str       The string initially given as the target.  It can be an IP address or a domain name
destination_address       str       An IP address represented as a string

protocol                  str       One of ``ICMP``, ``TCP``, ``UDP``
hops                      list      A list of :ref:`traceroute-hop` objects. If the ``parse_all_hops`` parameter is ``False``, this will only contain the last hop.
total_hops                int       The total number of hops
ip_path                   list      A list of list containing the IPs at each hop. This is just for convenience as all of these values are accessible via the :ref:`traceroute-hop` and :ref:`traceroute-packet` objects.
last_median_rtt           float     The median value of all RTTs from the last successful hop
destination_ip_responded  bool      Set to ``True`` if the last hop was a response from the destination IP
last_hop_responded        bool      Set to ``True`` if the last hop was a response at all
is_success                bool      Set to ``True`` if the traceroute finished successfully
last_hop_errors           list      A list of last hop's errors
========================  ========  ===================================================================================

It is also possible to supply the following parameter to control parsing of Traceroute results:

============== ==== ======= ===========
Parameter      Type Default Explanation
============== ==== ======= ===========
parse_all_hops bool True    Set to ``False`` to stop parsing ``Hop`` objects after the ``last_*`` properties (see above) have been set. This will cause ``hops`` to only contain the last ``Hop``.
============== ==== ======= ===========


.. _traceroute-hop:

Hop
----

Each hop in the traceroute is available as a ``Hop`` object.

internal_ttl             int         The time-to-live for the packet that triggered the error ICMP.  The default is 1
destination_option_size  int         The size of the IPv6 destination option header
hop_by_hop_option_size   int         The size of the IPv6 hop-by-hop option header
icmp_header              IcmpHeader  See :ref:`traceroute-icmp-header` below
=======================  ==========  ===========================================================================================


.. _traceroute-icmp-header:

IcmpHeader
----------

This class is slightly different than other parts of Sagan as it in ``objects``
we find a complex generic list containing generic dictionaries pulled directly
from the JSON blob.  The decision not to further parse this bob into separate
Python models was made based on the assumption that much of this section is very
edge-case and the contents are present sporadically.

If however there is a demand for further development of this portion of the
result, we can expand it.  Until then though, ``IcmpHeader`` is a very simple
class, the majority of data living in ``objects``.

For further information about this portion of a traceroute result, you should
consult our `data structure documentation`_

.. _data structure documentation: https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/data_struct/#v4610_traceroute

=====================  ==========  =========================================================================


.. _dns:

DNS
====

The most complicated result type, ``dns`` measurement results contain all of the
properties :ref:`common to all measurements <common-attributes>` as well as the following:


=====================  ========  ===================================================================================
Property               Type      Explanation
=====================  ========  ===================================================================================
responses              list      A list of DNS :ref:`dns-response` objects (see below)
=====================  ========  ===================================================================================


.. _dns-response:

Response
--------

Most DNS measurement results consist of a single response, but in some cases,
there may be more than one.  Regardless, every ``Response`` instance has the
following properties:

=====================  ========  ===================================================================================
Property               Type      Explanation
=====================  ========  ===================================================================================
raw_data               dict      The fragment of the initial JSON that pertains to this response
af                     int       The address family.  It's always either a ``4`` or a ``6``.
destination_address    str       An IP address represented as a string
source_address         str       An IP address represented as a string
protocol               str       One of ``TCP``, ``UDP``
abuf                   Message   See :ref:`dns-message` below
qbuf                   Message   See :ref:`dns-message` below
response_time          float     Time, in milliseconds until the response was received
response_id            int       The sequence number of this result within a group of results, available if the resolution was done by the probe's local resolver
=====================  ========  ===================================================================================


.. _dns-message:

Message
-------

Responses can contain either an ``abuf`` or a ``qbuf`` which are both ``Message``
objects.  If you want the string representation, simply cast the object as a
string with ``str()``.

=====================  ========  ===================================================================================
Property               Type      Explanation

authorities            list      A list of :ref:`dns-answer` objects, if any
additionals            list      A list of :ref:`dns-answer` objects, if any
=====================  ========  ===================================================================================

.. _dns-message-precalculatedvalues:

A note on pre-calculated values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when you pass a result into Sagan, it will attempt to parse the
``abuf`` and ``qbuf`` strings (if any) into ``Message`` objects.  However, some
of the values in that abuf may have already been pre-calculated and stored
alongside the other attributes in the result.  Many ``Header`` values for
example, can be found in the raw result (outside of the abuf string), so parsing
the abuf for these values is redundant and potentially unnecessary if these
values are all you need.

For this case, Sagan supports passing ``parse_buf=False`` to the ``DnsResult``
class.  If you opt for this method, the abuf will not be parsed, and any values
not immediately available in the result will return ``None``.  For example::


    from ripe.atlas.sagan import DnsResult
    my_result = DnsResult(
        '<some result data including name, type, and rdata, but not ttl or class>',
        parse_buf=False
    )
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].name       # "version.bind"
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].klass      # None
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].rd_length  # None
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].type       # "TXT"
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].ttl        # None
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].data       # "Some RDATA value"

Note also that ``Result.get()`` accepts ``parse_buf=`` as well::

    from ripe.atlas.sagan import Result
    my_result = Result.get(
        '<some result data including name, type, and rdata, but not ttl or class>',
        parse_buf=False
    )
    result.responses[0].abuf.answers[0].name  # "version.bind"
    ...
